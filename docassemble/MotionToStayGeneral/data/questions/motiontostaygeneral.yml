    * For example, if the Trial Court judge's order is unreasonable in light of the facts that that the judge heard at the hearing or trial, the issue of law would be whether the judge's order was an abuse of discretion.
    * For example, if you thought the judge mistakenly did not allow you to present a piece of evidence at the hearing or trial, the issue of law would be whether the judge improperly excluded evidence at the hearing or trial.

  Special instructions for the cover page
subquestion: |
  Before we deliver your form, you can include instructions on the cover
  page that will be sent to the clerk at the Massachusetts Appeals Court.
  
  For example, you may have special instructions about how and when to reach
  you that you did not already include in the contact information section.
  
  The clerk _may_ print the cover page and include it in the public file.

  Are there any instructions that you would like to give to the clerk that will
  receive your forms?

    What to include?
  content: |
    Include information that you want the clerk to know. The clerk is the person
    who will receive your paperwork and put it in an official court file. The
    clerk is not a decision maker on your case.

    Do not include information that is meant for the judge or the other party.
    Do not include information that is meant to be part of your official case.

    There is a chance this information may end up in the public court file, so
    do not include sensitive or private information.
